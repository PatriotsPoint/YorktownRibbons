            <p class="info">USS Laffey was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for her crew's actions on April 16,
                1945. At 8:30am she was about 30 mi (26 nmi; 48 km) north of Okinawa when about 50 imperial Japanese
                planes attacked the ship. Despite being badly damaged by four bombs, six kamikaze crashes, and strafing
                fire that killed 32 and wounded 71, the USS Laffey stayed afloat earning her the nickname "The ship
                that would not die." </p>

                she was assigned to Task Force 129, Group Two. Her mission was to complete the bombardment of
                Cherbourg, the inner harbor forts, and the area west towards the Atlantic. During this Laffey took a
                dud in her port bow by the anchor. The damage control party pried it loose and tossed it overboard.</p>
